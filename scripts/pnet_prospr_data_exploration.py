### Are there any matches? ###

# The prospr domain names were extracted from CATH. The
#   domain name has the following meaning:

# CHARACTERS 1-4: PDB Code

# CHARACTER 5: Chain Character
#   This determines which PDB chain is represented.
#   Chain characters of zero ('0') indicate that the PDB file has no chain field.

# CHARACTER 6-7: Domain Number
#   The domain number is a 2-figure, zero-padded number (e.g. '01', '02' ... ). 
#   Where the domain number is a double ZERO ('00') this indicates that the 
#   domain is a whole PDB chain with no domain chopping. 


# The ProteinNet Records
# <class>#<pdb_id>_<chain_number>_<chain_id>
# where the quantities inside <> are strings and space-delimited arrays of the 
# form previously described. The <class> field of the ID entry is only present 
# in the validation and test sets, and corresponds to the sequence identity class 
# and CASP class, respectively. For test set entries, the remainder of the ID 
# field only contains the CASP identifier.
